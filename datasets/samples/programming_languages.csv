https://example.com/java,Java Programming Language,"Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine regardless of the underlying computer architecture. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java is widely used for building enterprise software, Android applications, and web services.",example.com,programming
https://example.com/python,Python Programming Language,"Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is popular in data science, machine learning, web development, and automation.",example.com,programming
https://example.com/javascript,JavaScript Programming Language,"JavaScript is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995. It is essential for modern web development, powering interactive websites and web applications. JavaScript can run on both client-side (browsers) and server-side (Node.js).",example.com,programming
https://example.com/cpp,C++ Programming Language,"C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ is widely used in game development, system software, and high-performance applications.",example.com,programming
https://example.com/go,Go Programming Language,"Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. Go was designed to address common criticisms of other languages while maintaining their positive characteristics. Go is popular for cloud services, microservices, and concurrent programming due to its built-in support for goroutines and channels.",example.com,programming
